        <p>My name is Celeste and I am a paleoceanographer experienced in isotope geochemistry (stable and radiogenic), micropaleontology, and sedimentology. I use marine sediments to study tropical ocean-atmosphere interactions and ENSO in the eastern equatorial Pacific over recent glacial cycles, North Atlantic deep ocean circulation across the Pleistocene, and changes in global climate and ocean circulation across the Eocene. </p>
        <p>I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My research is a part of the interdisciplinary MIT Climate Grand Challenges project titled 'Preparing for a new world of weather and climate extremes.' My goal is to construct paleo-records of hyperthermal events during the Cenozoic Era, to better constrain the timescales of these events and changes in deep ocean chemistry and circulation.</p>
        <p>I completed my Ph.D. in Earth and Environmental Sciences at Columbia University in 2025. My dissertation research focused on several aspects of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system in the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP). I generated paleo-records of EEP thermocline depth, paleo-productivity, carbon cycling, and sea surface variability. I conducted stable isotope analysis of planktic foraminifera and uranium series isotope analysis (U-Th-Pa) of marine sediments. I was advised by Jerry F. McManus and conducted my research at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO). I also graduated from Barnard College of Columbia University with a B.A. in Environmental Science in 2019. As an undergraduate, I worked at LDEO on the Long Island Sound Mapping Project and GEOTRACES with Timothy Kenna and Frank Nitsche.</p>
